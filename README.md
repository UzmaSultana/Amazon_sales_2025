# Amazon_sales_2025

This Power BI dashboard presents a clear overview of Amazon sales performance for 2025. It highlights key metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, and cost, along with insights into top-selling products and customer locations. The interactive filters allow users to explore data by payment method, region, and order status.
The project includes three key components:

The dataset - which contains the raw sales data;

The Power BI dashboard - which transforms that data into meaningful visuals;

The PowerPoint presentation - which summarizes the findings, showcases the dashboard visuals, and highlights key business insights for stakeholders.

These 3 Documents together provides complete, data-driven analysis to support strategic decisions.
